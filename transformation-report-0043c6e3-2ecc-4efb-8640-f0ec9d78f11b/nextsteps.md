# Next Steps

The transformation appears to have completed successfully. No build errors were detected across any of the projects in the solution. Below are recommended steps to validate and deploy your migrated project.

## 1. Restore Dependencies

Run the following command to ensure all NuGet packages are properly restored:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

Review the output for any warnings related to package compatibility or deprecated packages targeting older frameworks.

## 2. Build the Solution

Perform a full solution build to confirm the absence of errors in a clean build environment:

```bash
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

Address any warnings that surface during this step, particularly those related to nullable reference types or obsolete APIs, as these can indicate subtle compatibility issues.

## 3. Run Existing Tests

If the solution contains test projects, execute them to verify that behavior has not changed during migration:

```bash
dotnet test --configuration Release
```

Review test output carefully. Any failing tests should be investigated to determine whether they indicate a regression introduced by the migration or a pre-existing issue.

## 4. Verify Target Framework

Open each `.csproj` file and confirm that the `<TargetFramework>` element is set to the intended cross-platform .NET version (e.g., `net8.0`). Example:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
</PropertyGroup>
```

## 5. Check for Platform-Specific API Usage

Review the codebase for any remaining usage of Windows-specific APIs that may not be available on Linux or macOS. Tools that can assist with this include:

- The [.NET Upgrade Assistant](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/upgrade-assistant-overview)
- The [Platform Compatibility Analyzer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/analyzers/platform-compat-analyzer), which will emit warnings for platform-specific calls

## 6. Test on Target Platforms

If cross-platform support is a goal, run and test the application on each intended operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS) to surface any runtime issues that do not appear at compile time.

## 7. Review Configuration and File Paths

Ensure that any file paths, configuration file references, or environment-specific settings in the code use `Path.Combine` or equivalent cross-platform approaches rather than hardcoded path separators.

## 8. Publish the Application

Once validation is complete, publish the application using the appropriate runtime identifier for your target environment:

```bash
dotnet publish --configuration Release --runtime linux-x64 --self-contained false
```

Replace `linux-x64` with the appropriate runtime identifier for your deployment target (e.g., `win-x64`, `osx-x64`). Review the contents of the publish output directory before deploying.
