# Next Steps

The transformation appears to have completed successfully. There are no build errors present in the solution. Below are steps to validate, test, and deploy your migrated project.

## 1. Verify Target Framework

Open `AdoCore.csproj` and confirm the `<TargetFramework>` element is set to the intended cross-platform .NET version, for example:

```xml
<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
```

Ensure this aligns with the .NET SDK version installed on your machine. Run the following to confirm your SDK version:

```bash
dotnet --version
```

## 2. Restore Dependencies

Run a NuGet restore to ensure all packages are resolved correctly:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

Review the output for any warnings about deprecated packages or packages that may not be fully compatible with the target framework.

## 3. Build the Solution

Perform a full build to confirm there are no compilation issues:

```bash
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

Address any warnings that surface during the build, particularly those related to nullable reference types or obsolete API usage, as these can indicate compatibility concerns.

## 4. Run Existing Tests

If the solution contains a test project, execute the test suite to verify that existing functionality behaves as expected:

```bash
dotnet test --configuration Release
```

Review test output carefully. Any failing tests should be investigated to determine whether they are caused by behavioral differences between the legacy .NET Framework and the new cross-platform .NET runtime.

## 5. Check for Platform-Specific API Usage

Review the codebase for any APIs that were available in .NET Framework but are absent or behave differently in cross-platform .NET. Common areas to check include:

- `System.Web` references (not available in cross-platform .NET)
- Windows Registry access (`Microsoft.Win32.Registry`)
- `AppDomain` usage
- `BinaryFormatter` (deprecated and disabled by default)
- COM interop or P/Invoke calls targeting Windows-specific libraries

Use the [.NET Upgrade Assistant compatibility analyzer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/upgrade-assistant-overview) or the `Microsoft.DotNet.PlatformAbstractions` tooling to identify remaining compatibility issues.

## 6. Test on Target Platforms

If cross-platform support is a goal, run and validate the application on each intended operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS) to surface any platform-specific runtime issues that would not appear during a Windows-only build.

```bash
dotnet run --configuration Release
```

## 7. Review Configuration Files

Ensure that any configuration previously handled by `App.config` or `Web.config` has been migrated appropriately to `appsettings.json` or environment variables, as the legacy XML-based configuration system has limited support in cross-platform .NET.

## 8. Publish the Application

Once validation is complete, publish the application for your target environment:

**Framework-dependent publish:**
```bash
dotnet publish --configuration Release --output ./publish
```

**Self-contained publish (includes the .NET runtime):**
```bash
dotnet publish --configuration Release --self-contained true --runtime linux-x64 --output ./publish
```

Replace `linux-x64` with the appropriate runtime identifier (`win-x64`, `osx-x64`, etc.) for your deployment target. A full list of runtime identifiers is available in the [Microsoft RID catalog](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog).
