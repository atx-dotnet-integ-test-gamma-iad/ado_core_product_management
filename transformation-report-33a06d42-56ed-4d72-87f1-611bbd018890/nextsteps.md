# Next Steps

The transformation appears to have completed successfully. There are no build errors present in the solution. Below are steps to validate, test, and deploy your migrated project.

## 1. Verify Target Framework

Open `AdoCore.csproj` and confirm the target framework is set to the intended cross-platform version, for example:

```xml
<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
```

Ensure this aligns with the .NET version installed on your machine by running:

```bash
dotnet --version
```

## 2. Restore Dependencies

Run a NuGet restore to confirm all packages resolve correctly against the new target framework:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

Review the output for any warnings about deprecated packages or packages that do not fully support the target framework.

## 3. Build the Solution

Perform a clean build to confirm there are no errors or warnings introduced at compile time:

```bash
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

Address any warnings that surface, particularly those related to nullable reference types or obsolete APIs, as these can indicate areas that may cause runtime issues.

## 4. Run Existing Tests

If the solution contains test projects, execute them to verify that existing functionality has not regressed:

```bash
dotnet test --configuration Release
```

Review test output carefully. Any failing tests should be investigated to determine whether they are caused by behavioral differences between the legacy .NET Framework and the new cross-platform .NET runtime.

## 5. Check for Platform-Specific API Usage

Review the codebase for any APIs that were available in .NET Framework but are not available or behave differently in cross-platform .NET. Common areas to check include:

- `System.Web` references (not available in cross-platform .NET)
- Windows Registry access (`Microsoft.Win32.Registry`)
- Windows-only file path assumptions (e.g., backslash separators)
- `AppDomain` usage, which has limited support
- COM interop or P/Invoke calls targeting Windows-specific libraries

Use the [.NET Upgrade Assistant compatibility analyzer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/upgrade-assistant-overview) or the `Microsoft.DotNet.PlatformAbstractions` tooling to identify remaining compatibility concerns.

## 6. Test on Target Platforms

If cross-platform support is a goal, run and validate the application on each intended operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS) to surface any platform-specific runtime issues that do not appear at compile time:

```bash
dotnet run --configuration Release
```

## 7. Publish the Application

Once validation is complete, publish the application for the target runtime. For a self-contained deployment targeting Linux x64 as an example:

```bash
dotnet publish --configuration Release --runtime linux-x64 --self-contained true
```

For a framework-dependent deployment:

```bash
dotnet publish --configuration Release
```

Review the contents of the `publish` output directory to confirm all required assets are present before deploying to the target environment.
