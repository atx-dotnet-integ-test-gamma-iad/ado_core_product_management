# Next Steps

The transformation appears to have completed successfully. No build errors were detected across any of the projects in the solution. Below are recommended steps to validate and deploy your migrated project.

## 1. Verify Target Framework

Open `AdoCore.csproj` and confirm the `<TargetFramework>` element is set to the intended .NET version (e.g., `net8.0` or `net6.0`). For example:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
</PropertyGroup>
```

## 2. Restore and Build Locally

Run the following commands from the solution root to confirm a clean restore and build:

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

Ensure there are no warnings that could indicate deprecated APIs or packages that may cause runtime issues.

## 3. Review NuGet Package Versions

Check that all NuGet dependencies referenced in `AdoCore.csproj` are compatible with the target framework. Run the following to identify outdated packages:

```bash
dotnet list package --outdated
```

Update any packages that have newer stable versions compatible with your target framework.

## 4. Run Existing Tests

If the solution contains test projects, execute them to verify that existing functionality behaves as expected:

```bash
dotnet test --configuration Release
```

Review any failing tests carefully, as they may indicate behavioral differences between the legacy .NET Framework and the new cross-platform .NET runtime.

## 5. Check for Platform-Specific API Usage

Review the code for any APIs that were available in .NET Framework but are not available or behave differently in cross-platform .NET. Common areas to check include:

- `System.Web` references (not available in .NET Core/.NET 5+)
- Windows Registry access (`Microsoft.Win32.Registry`)
- `AppDomain` usage
- Remoting or `BinaryFormatter`

Use the [.NET Upgrade Assistant compatibility analyzer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/upgrade-assistant-overview) or the `Microsoft.DotNet.PlatformAbstractions` tooling to identify these.

## 6. Test on Target Operating Systems

Since the goal is cross-platform support, run and validate the application on each intended operating system (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS):

```bash
dotnet run --configuration Release
```

Pay attention to file path separators, line endings, and OS-specific behaviors that may surface at runtime but not at compile time.

## 7. Publish the Application

Once validation is complete, publish the application using the appropriate runtime identifier for your target environment:

```bash
dotnet publish --configuration Release --runtime linux-x64 --self-contained true
```

Or for a framework-dependent deployment:

```bash
dotnet publish --configuration Release
```

Review the output in the `publish` folder to confirm all required assets are present before deploying to the target environment.
