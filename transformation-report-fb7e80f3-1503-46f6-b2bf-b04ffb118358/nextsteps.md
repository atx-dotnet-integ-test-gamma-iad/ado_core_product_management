# Next Steps

The transformation appears to have completed successfully. No build errors were detected across any of the projects in the solution. Below are recommended steps to validate and deploy your migrated project.

## 1. Restore Dependencies

Run the following command to ensure all NuGet packages are properly restored:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

Review the output for any warnings related to package compatibility or deprecated packages targeting older frameworks.

## 2. Build the Solution

Perform a full solution build to confirm the absence of errors in a clean build environment:

```bash
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

Address any warnings that surface during this step, particularly those related to nullable reference types or obsolete APIs, as these can indicate subtle compatibility issues.

## 3. Run Existing Tests

If the solution contains test projects, execute them to verify that behavior has not changed during migration:

```bash
dotnet test --configuration Release
```

Review test output carefully. Any failing tests should be investigated to determine whether they reflect a regression introduced during migration or a pre-existing issue.

## 4. Verify Target Framework

Open each `.csproj` file and confirm that the `<TargetFramework>` element is set to the intended .NET version, for example:

```xml
<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
```

Ensure consistency across all projects in the solution, particularly for shared libraries.

## 5. Review Removed or Changed APIs

Cross-platform .NET removes or modifies certain APIs that were available in .NET Framework. Use the [.NET Upgrade Assistant compatibility analyzer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/upgrade-assistant-overview) or the `Microsoft.DotNet.PlatformAbstractions` tooling to identify any runtime-level incompatibilities that do not surface as build errors.

Pay particular attention to:
- `System.Configuration` usage
- Windows Registry access
- `System.Drawing` (requires additional packages on non-Windows platforms)
- WCF client/server usage

## 6. Test on Target Platforms

If cross-platform support is a goal, run and test the application on each intended operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS) to catch platform-specific runtime issues that would not appear during a Windows-only build.

```bash
dotnet run --configuration Release
```

## 7. Publish the Application

Once validation is complete, publish the application using the appropriate runtime identifier for your deployment target:

```bash
dotnet publish --configuration Release --runtime win-x64 --self-contained false
```

Replace `win-x64` with the appropriate runtime identifier (e.g., `linux-x64`, `osx-x64`) based on your deployment environment. Use `--self-contained true` if you require the .NET runtime to be bundled with the output.

## 8. Review Output Directory

After publishing, inspect the output directory to confirm all expected assemblies, configuration files, and assets are present before deploying to the target environment.
