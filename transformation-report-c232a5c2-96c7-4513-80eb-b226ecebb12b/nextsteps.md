# Next Steps

The transformation appears to have completed successfully. No build errors were detected across any of the projects in the solution. Below are recommended steps to validate and deploy your migrated project.

## 1. Verify Target Framework

Open `AdoCore.csproj` and confirm the `<TargetFramework>` element is set to the intended .NET version (e.g., `net8.0` or `net6.0`). For example:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
</PropertyGroup>
```

## 2. Restore and Build Locally

Run the following commands from the solution root to confirm a clean restore and build:

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

Ensure there are no warnings that could indicate deprecated APIs or packages that may cause runtime issues.

## 3. Review NuGet Package Versions

Check that all NuGet dependencies referenced in `AdoCore.csproj` are compatible with the target framework. Run the following to identify outdated packages:

```bash
dotnet list package --outdated
```

Update any packages that have newer stable versions compatible with your target framework.

## 4. Run Existing Tests

If the solution contains test projects, execute them to verify that existing functionality behaves as expected after migration:

```bash
dotnet test --configuration Release
```

Review any test failures carefully, as they may indicate behavioral differences between the legacy .NET Framework and the new cross-platform .NET runtime.

## 5. Check for Platform-Specific API Usage

Review the source code for any APIs that were available in .NET Framework but are not fully supported or behave differently in cross-platform .NET. Common areas to inspect include:

- `System.Web` references (not available in .NET Core/.NET 5+)
- Windows Registry access (`Microsoft.Win32.Registry`)
- `AppDomain` usage
- `BinaryFormatter` (deprecated and disabled by default)
- COM interop or P/Invoke calls targeting Windows-specific libraries

Use the [.NET Upgrade Assistant compatibility analyzer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/upgrade-assistant-overview) or the `Microsoft.DotNet.PlatformCompat.Analyzer` NuGet package to surface any remaining compatibility issues.

## 6. Test on Target Platforms

If cross-platform support is a goal, run and validate the application on each intended operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS) to catch any platform-specific runtime issues that do not surface at compile time.

```bash
dotnet run --configuration Release
```

## 7. Publish the Application

Once validation is complete, publish the application using the appropriate runtime identifier for your deployment target:

```bash
# Framework-dependent deployment
dotnet publish --configuration Release --output ./publish

# Self-contained deployment (example for Linux x64)
dotnet publish --configuration Release --runtime linux-x64 --self-contained true --output ./publish
```

Review the contents of the `./publish` directory to confirm all required files are present before deploying to the target environment.
