# Next Steps

The transformation appears to have completed successfully. No build errors were detected across any of the projects in the solution. Below are recommended steps to validate and deploy your migrated project.

## 1. Restore Dependencies

Run the following command from the solution root to ensure all NuGet packages are properly restored:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

Review the output for any warnings related to package compatibility or deprecated packages targeting older frameworks.

## 2. Build the Solution

Perform a full solution build to confirm the absence of errors in a clean build context:

```bash
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

Address any warnings that surface during this step, particularly those related to nullable reference types or platform compatibility analyzers, as these can indicate latent issues.

## 3. Run Existing Tests

If the solution contains test projects, execute them to verify that behavior has not changed during migration:

```bash
dotnet test --configuration Release
```

Review test output carefully. Any failing tests should be investigated to determine whether they reflect a regression introduced during migration or a pre-existing issue.

## 4. Verify Target Framework

Open each `.csproj` file and confirm that the `<TargetFramework>` element references the intended cross-platform .NET version (e.g., `net8.0`). Ensure no projects are still referencing `net48` or other Windows-only framework monikers unless intentional.

## 5. Check for Windows-Specific APIs

Run the .NET Compatibility Analyzer or review code manually for any usage of Windows-specific APIs (e.g., registry access, Windows Forms, certain `System.Drawing` calls). These will not function on Linux or macOS without additional packages or refactoring.

You can use the following tool to assist with this:

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.DotNet.Analyzers.Compatibility
```

## 6. Test on Target Platforms

If cross-platform support is a goal, run and test the application on each intended operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS) to surface any runtime issues that do not appear at compile time.

```bash
dotnet run --configuration Release
```

## 7. Publish the Application

Once validation is complete, publish the application using the appropriate runtime identifier for your target environment:

```bash
dotnet publish --configuration Release --runtime linux-x64 --self-contained true
```

Replace `linux-x64` with the appropriate runtime identifier for your deployment target (e.g., `win-x64`, `osx-x64`). Use `--self-contained false` if the target machine has the .NET runtime installed.

## 8. Review Output Artifacts

Inspect the output of the publish step in the `bin/Release/{framework}/{runtime}/publish/` directory to confirm all expected files are present, including configuration files and static assets.
